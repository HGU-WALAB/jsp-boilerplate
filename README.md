* JDBC: Provides JDBC support for database connectivity in Spring Boot.
* MySQL Driver: The MySQL JDBC driver for connecting to MySQL databases.
* MyBatis 3: Integration of MyBatis with Spring Boot for SQL mapping and persistence.
* H2 Database: In-memory database commonly used for development and testing purposes.
* Lombok: A library for automatic code generation, reducing boilerplate code in development.
* JSP (Tomcat Jasper): Support for JavaServer Pages (JSP) using Tomcat Jasper in Spring Boot.
* JSTL: Jakarta Standard Tag Library, offering a set of tags for JSP pages.
* JUnit 5: Testing framework for writing and running tests in Java.

## What do I need?

  * If you're considering Java 8 or above, you can use [this](https://github.com/HGU-WALAB/jsp-starter-kit/releases/tag/v2.7.x) instead.
* Docker (optional): this will be used to deploy the project.

## How do I use it?

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open the project and <u>**enable annotation processing**</u>.
3. Run the project and open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
4. If you can see the message `Welcome to My JSP Page!`, you're good to go!
5. Modify the project to suit your needs.

## How do I deploy this?

This guide uses Docker to host the project. Install Docker if you haven't already.

1. Log in to Docker Hub using `docker login`.
2. Make sure that context path is set to the root of this repository.
3. Run `docker buildx build --push --platform linux/amd64 -t <username>/<tag> .`
    * Replace `<username>` with your Docker Hub username and `<tag>` with the tag you want to use.
    * If you're using a different platform, replace `linux/amd64` with the platform you're using.
4. Connect to your server to be used for hosting and make sure Docker is installed.
5. Run `docker pull <username>/<tag>` to pull the image in the server.
6. Run `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <username>/<tag>` to run the image.
